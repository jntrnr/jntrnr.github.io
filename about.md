I'm a developer and technical program manager focused on strong technical excellence in programming languages and software engineering.  I led the <a href="http://typescriptlang.org">TypeScript team</a> from its initial release to its use in major frameworks. I also helped design parts of <a href="http://clang.llvm.org">Clang/LLVM</a>, <a href="http://chapel.cray.com/">Chapel</a>, and <a href="http://chaiscript.com">ChaiScript</a>.

But whatever.  Technology is fun.  Come say hi :)  [@jntrnr](https://twitter.com/jntrnr)
