    <h1>Nushell 0.5.0</h1>

    <p>Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works
        seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it
        easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.</p>

    <p>Today, we’re happy to announce the 0.5.0 release for Nu. We’ve got lots of new features, including some
        long-requested ones, in this release.</p>

    <h2>Where to get it</h2>

    <p>Nu 0.5.0 is available as <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0_5_0">pre-built binaries</a>
        or from <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nu">crates.io</a>. If you have Rust installed you can install it
        using <code>cargo +beta install nu</code> (or if you want all the features <code>cargo +beta install nu
        --all-features</code>).</p>

    <h2>What's new</h2>
    <h3>Nu as a login shell (jonathandturner)</h3>

    <p>One of the key features that landed in 0.5.0 is set of new capabilities that work together to allow you to use Nu
        as a login shell, completely independent of bash or other hosting shells. For this, we’ve built in support for
        querying and updating the environment variables and the path.</p>

    <p>To get started, you’ll need to first copy the environment you’re using into the config. Luckily, we’ve also made
        some improvements there:</p>

    <pre>
> config --set [path $nu:path]
> config --set [env $nu:env]</pre>

    <p>Once these values are set, you’ll be able to use Nu as your login shell.</p>

    <h3>New variables</h3>

    <p>As you saw above, we’ve added a few new built-in variables. These will let you know what the current values that
        Nu can see are for your environment, path, and the config itself.</p>

    <pre>
> echo $nu:env
> echo $nu:path
> echo $nu:config</pre>

    <h3>
        Adding paths to your PATH
    </h3>

    <p>
        One of the first things you’ll notice is that the new $nu:path is structured. If you run the echo above, you
        might
        see something like this:
    </p>

    <pre>
> echo $nu:path
───┬──────────────────
 # │ &lt;value&gt;
───┼──────────────────
 0 │ /usr/local/sbin
 1 │ /usr/local/bin
 2 │ /usr/sbin
 3 │ /usr/bin
 4 │ /sbin
 5 │ /bin
 6 │ /usr/games
 7 │ /usr/local/games
 8 │ /snap/bin
───┴──────────────────</pre>

    <p>
        We’ve added two new commands: prepend for adding items to the start of a table and append for adding items to
        the end of a table. With these commands, we can now query out the path, update it, and save it back.
    </p>

    <pre>> echo $nu:path | prepend "/my/new/directory" | config --set_into path</pre>

    <h3>
        Adding variables to your environment
    </h3>

    <p>
        You can use a similar set of steps to add new variables, or change existing variables, in your environment.
    </p>

    <pre>> echo $nu:env | insert GREETING hello_world | config --set_into env</pre>

    <p>
        <i>
            Note: the previous `add` command of previous releases has been renamed `insert` to remove confusion with
            mathematical functions.
        </i>
    </p>

    <h3>
        On-going improvements
    </h3>

    <p>
        We’re continuing to improve the commands we currently ship as part of Nu. Here are a few you might find helpful:
    </p>

    <h4>
        Substrings (Flare576)
    </h4>

    <p>
        The str command now supports being able to retrieve a substring from the strings given, so you could return, for
        example, the first 5 characters and stop after that.
    </p>

    <pre>
> ls | get name
────┬────────────────────
  # │ &lt;value&gt;
────┼────────────────────
  0 │ target
  1 │ CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
  2 │ .cargo
  3 │ src
  4 │ features.toml
  5 │ rustfmt.toml

> ls | get name | str --substring "0,3"
────┬─────────
  # │ &lt;value&gt;
────┼─────────
  0 │ tar
  1 │ COD
  2 │ .ca
  3 │ src
  4 │ fea
  5 │ rus</pre>

    <h4>
        Recycling (jdvr)
    </h4>

    <p>
        Ever wish you could rm things, but not forever? You can now tell rm to send items to your platform’s
        recycle bin rather than deleting them forever. As with our other commands, this works across all the
        platforms that Nu supports.
    </p>

    <pre>
> rm myfile.txt --trash</pre>
