    <h1>Nushell 0.3.0</h1>

    <p>
        Nushell, or Nu for short, is a new shell that takes a modern, structured approach to your commandline. It works
        seamlessly with the data from your filesystem, operating system, and a growing number of file formats to make it
        easy to build powerful commandline pipelines.
    </p>

    <p>
        We’re happy to announce that today we’re releasing Nushell 0.3.0. Nu has seen numerous bugfixes, performance
        improvements, and features added since its initial public release (which was only a few weeks ago!)
    </p>

    <h2>Where to get it</h2>

    <p>Nu 0.3.0 is available as <a href="https://github.com/nushell/nushell/releases/tag/0_3_0">pre-built binaries</a>
        or from <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nu">crates.io</a>. If you have Rust installed you can install it
        using <code>cargo +nightly install nu</code> (or if you want all the features <code>cargo +nightly install nu
        --all-features</code>).</p>

    <h2>What's new</h2>

    <h3>
        New table design (Porges, jonathandturner)
    </h3>

    <img src="/images/utf8_table.png" alt="Table with nice utf-8 lines">

    <p>
        One of the most striking differences is that Nu now uses UTF-8 box drawing to draw its tables.
    </p>

    <img src="/images/utf8_light_table.png" alt="A lighter version of utf-8 table">

    <p>
        The table is also configurable. If you feel like the table is a bit too heavy, you can also configure it to work
        in light mode using this command:
    </p>

    <pre>> config --set [table_mode light]</pre>

    <h3>
        New file formats (pmeredit, est31, andrasio, jonathandturner)
    </h3>

    <p>
        Nu now natively supports new file formats, including: bson, tsv, sqlite, and url-encoded strings.
    </p>
    <h3>
        New commands (incrop, ramonsnir, ijt, jonathandturner, andrasio, JonnyWalker81, chhetripradeep, pka)
    </h3>

    <p>
        Since the 0.2.0 release, Nu has gained a set of additional commands, including:

        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>help</code> - built-in help system
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>reverse</code> - reverse a table
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>last</code> - like the first command, but working from the bottom of the table, return n rows
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>embed</code> - create a new table using the current table as a start
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>fetch</code> - get the contents of a URL (this originally lived in open)
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>post</code> - post to a URL and get the results
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>pwd</code> - print the working directory
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>env</code> - give access to a number of important paths and environment settings
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>pivot</code> - pivot a table so that rows become columns and vice-versa
            </li>
            <li>
                <code>echo</code> - a built-in echo command
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>
        Error improvements (jonathandturner)
    </h3>

    <img src="/images/did_you_mean.png" alt="Improved error messages">

    <p>
        We’ve made steady progress on improving error messages. Recently, we added “did you mean?” errors to help when
        you mistype the name of columns. Nu 0.3.0 also has gone through a few passes to generally polish the errors to
        include more information when an error occurs.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Shell features (pka, wycats, twe4ked, andrasio, iamcodemaker)
    </h3>

    <p>
        Nu now supports ~ to refer to your home directory as part of a path. You can also use cd - to return to a
        previous directory you were working in.
    </p>

    <p>
        The shell itself also got a few updates. You can now enable ‘vi’ mode, if you’d prefer vi-like bindings (by
        running config --set [edit_mode vi]). On non-Windows platforms, you can also use Ctrl-R to enable Sublime-style
        history searching (we’re hoping to enable Windows support for this soon).
    </p>
    <h3>
        Plugin improvements (jonathandturner, andrasio)
    </h3>

    <p>
        Plugins have continued to mature, and it’s now possible to use plugins to extend Nu with support for new file
        formats.
    </p>

    <p>
        We’ve also added documentation on how to write Nu plugins in both Rust and Python, with info on Ruby coming
        soon.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Docker support (vsoch, DrSensor)
    </h3>

    <p>
        If you’re interested in using Nu and Docker together, be sure to check out the new Docker support.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Book progress
    </h3>

    <p>
        The Nu book is now available in three languages: English, Spanish, and Japanese.
    </p>

    <p>
        We’ve also created a Nu contributor book, which will help developers who want to contribute to Nu learn about
        its philosophy, design, and how to create plugins.
